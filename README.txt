# CSS-Grid

The new CSS Grid spec offers unprecedented control when it comes to constructing layouts and components. In fact, this level of power and flexibility has never been available before now. That being said, there's a slight learning curve.

1.First Grid 
Let's get started at the very beginning. How do we construct our first 2x3 grid? This episode will introduce you to a handful of new CSS properties.

2.Position it Anywhere (grid.html)
We now have unprecedented control over how we position items within a grid. No longer are we forced to rearrange HTML to a move a region from one position to another. There's literally no limit to how you organize your layouts.

4.Named Grid Areas (grid-areas.html)
Each grid item can optionally be assigned a grid-area name. The container can then use these referenced names to construct your desired grid using a more readable convention.

5.The Fractional Unit (FractionalUnit.html)
When reviewing CSS grid demos, you'll likely come across the new fr measurement type. This stands for fraction, and allows us to easily specify how much of a grid's remaining available space should be taken up. Let's review a few examples in this episode.

6.Nested Grids (NestedGrids.html)
As it turns out, any item within a grid can also serve as its own grid container. This allows for a near infinite array of layout possibilities.

7.The Tricky Auto-Fill and Auto-Fit (AutoFillAndAutoFit.html)
The auto-fill and auto-fit keywords offer a lot of flexibility when it comes to dynamically constructing and distributing grid tracks. But, understanding the difference between the two can be tricky. Let's break it down as succinctly as we can.
